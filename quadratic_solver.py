#This package contains a quadratic solver
import math

##A solver for quadratic equations in the form ax^2+bx+c=0
#Will return any roots of the equation in a list
#If complex roots are allowed, the returned values may be complex
#If complex roots are not allowed and there are no non-complex roots then a ValueError will be returned
#If both the quadratic and linear coefficients are zero then a ValueError will be returned
#@param a (numeric) The quadratic coefficient
#@param b (numeric) The linear coefficient
#@param c (numeric) The constant
#@param complex_allowed (optional) (bool) If True, complex roots will be returned (if appropriate). If False, a ValueError will be returned if the dicrimnant is negative
